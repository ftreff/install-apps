# install-apps
Downloads and Installs my most used packages and applications.

These are all the applications/packages I tipically download after a fresh linux installation.
Instead of installing them one by one and trying to remember if i missed anything, I decided to write a script to run after I install a fresh copy of linux.

GoTop
Docker.io
HTOP - newest version (some distros bundle an outdated version.
NeoFetch
XMRig
XMRig-MO
Screen
Libsensors5 - (for HTOP to show CPU temp)

List is a work in progress, newpackages/applications will be added as i remember or need them.
